// Real song lyrics

// A partridge in a pear tree,
// Two turtle doves,
// Three french hens,
// Four calling birds,
// Five gold rings,
// Six geese a-laying
// Seven swans a-swimming,
// Eight maids a-milking,
// Nine ladies dancing,
// Ten lords a-leaping,
// Eleven pipers piping,
// Twelve drummers drumming.
